# Object Orientated Programming
Learning Object Orientated Programming in Python

## Classes
They allow us to logically group our data (attributes) and functions (methods) in a way that's is easy to reause and also easy to build upon if needed.
A class is basically a blueprint for creating intances. Each unique object that is created using a certain class will be an instance of tha class.

## Instances
Instance variables contain data that is unique to each instance.

## Class Variables
Class variables are variables that are shared among all instancesof a class. While instances variables can be unique for each instance, class variales shoul be the same for each instance.

## Class Methods
A class method is a method whcih si bound to the class and not the the object of the class. They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.

## Static Methods
Stati methods, much like class methods, are methods that are bound neither to a class or object. They do not require a class instance creation or the class itself.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, alsoc called derived class.
